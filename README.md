# Assignment_28th_March

I have done question no:3 for the previous assignment.I was supposed to fork our group's repository and create the graph by 
using the code from the forked repository for the remaining 3 questions which was done by my group members.
But since our hostels didn't have internet connectivity for a couple of days,i couldn't 
fork the repository when i was starting the assignment.So,i copied the code of other 3 questions from one of my friend(who is in
another group)and worked on that code to create the graph.I hope this wouldn't be a problem.
